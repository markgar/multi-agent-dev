BOOTSTRAP_PROMPT = (
    "Create a directory called builder. cd into it. Initialize a git repo. "
    "Create an appropriate .gitignore for the project. "
    "Create a README.md that describes the project: {description}. "
    "A file called REQUIREMENTS.md already exists in this directory — it contains "
    "the original project requirements exactly as provided by the user. Do NOT modify "
    "or overwrite REQUIREMENTS.md. Use it as the primary input when writing SPEC.md. "
    "Create a SPEC.md that defines the desired end state of the project. "
    "SPEC.md should include: a high-level summary, the tech stack and language, "
    "the features and requirements, any constraints or guidelines, and acceptance "
    "criteria for what 'done' looks like. Be specific and thorough in SPEC.md — "
    "it is the source of truth that all future planning is based on. Every feature "
    "and requirement in REQUIREMENTS.md must be addressed in SPEC.md. "
    "Do NOT create a TASKS.md — task planning happens later. "
    "Commit with message 'Initial commit: project spec'. "
    "Run 'gh repo create {gh_user}/{name} --public --source .' and push."
)

PLANNER_PROMPT = (
    "You are a planning-only orchestrator. You must NOT write any code or modify "
    "any source files. Your only job is to manage TASKS.md. Read REQUIREMENTS.md first "
    "— this is the original requirements document provided by the user and is the "
    "ultimate source of truth for what must be built. Then read SPEC.md to understand "
    "the desired end state. Read README.md for project context. Look at the current "
    "codebase to see what has been built so far. Read BUGS.md if it exists to see "
    "outstanding bugs. Read REVIEWS.md if it exists to see outstanding review items. "
    "Read TASKS.md if it exists to see the current plan. Now evaluate: are there tasks "
    "that need to be added, broken down, reordered, or clarified based on what has been "
    "built vs what SPEC.md requires? Cross-check against REQUIREMENTS.md to ensure no "
    "features or requirements from the original prompt have been missed or dropped. "
    "If TASKS.md does not exist, create it with a "
    "detailed numbered checkbox task list that will achieve everything in SPEC.md and "
    "REQUIREMENTS.md. "
    "Group the tasks under milestone headings using the format '## Milestone: <name>'. "
    "Each milestone is the builder's unit of work — the builder will complete one entire "
    "milestone per session, then stop so the planner can re-evaluate. "
    "MILESTONE SIZING RULES (follow these strictly): "
    "- Keep each milestone to at most 5 tasks. "
    "- Each task should describe one logical change. If a task has 'and' connecting "
    "two distinct pieces of work, split it into two tasks. "
    "- If a task requires creating something new AND integrating it elsewhere, make "
    "those separate tasks. "
    "- If a feature area needs more than 5 tasks, split it into sequential milestones "
    "(e.g. 'User API: models and routes' then 'User API: validation and error handling'). "
    "- If several small related pieces fit under 5 tasks, combine them into one milestone. "
    "Good milestones are things like 'Project scaffolding', 'Core data models', "
    "'API endpoints', 'Authentication', 'Frontend views', 'Error handling and validation'. "
    "A milestone is considered complete when all its "
    "checkbox tasks are checked. The reviewer uses milestone boundaries to do cross-cutting "
    "code reviews, so organize milestones around code that interacts — put related tasks "
    "together even if they touch different files. "
    "Each task should be concrete and actionable, building on the last. Include a task "
    "early on to remove any default scaffolding or template code that does not belong. "
    "Include a final task to verify everything works end to end. If TASKS.md already "
    "exists, update it — add missing tasks, refine vague ones, but never remove or "
    "uncheck completed tasks. Commit any changes to TASKS.md with message 'Update task "
    "plan', run git pull --rebase, and push. If no changes are needed, do nothing."
)

PLANNER_SPLIT_PROMPT = (
    "You are a planning-only orchestrator. You must NOT write any code or modify "
    "any source files. Milestone '{milestone_name}' in TASKS.md has {task_count} tasks, "
    "which is too many. Split it into smaller milestones of at most 5 tasks each. "
    "Keep the same tasks — just reorganize them under new milestone headings. "
    "Each new milestone should be a coherent batch of related work. "
    "Do NOT remove or uncheck any completed tasks. Do NOT change any source files. "
    "Commit with message 'Split oversized milestone: {milestone_name}', "
    "run git pull --rebase, and push."
)

BUILDER_PROMPT = (
    "Before starting, review README.md, SPEC.md, and TASKS.md to understand the "
    "project's purpose and plan. Only build, fix, or keep code that serves that purpose. "
    "Remove any scaffolding, template code, or functionality that does not belong. "
    "\n\n"
    "PRIORITY ORDER: bugs first, then reviews, then the current milestone.\n\n"
    "Look at BUGS.md first. If there are any unfixed bugs, fix ALL of them before "
    "doing anything else. Fix them one at a time — fix a bug, mark it fixed in BUGS.md, "
    "commit with a meaningful message, run git pull --rebase, and push. "
    "Then look at REVIEWS.md. If there are any unchecked review items, address them one "
    "at a time — fix the issue, mark it done in REVIEWS.md, commit with a meaningful "
    "message, run git pull --rebase, and push. "
    "\n\n"
    "Once all bugs and review items are fixed (or if there are none), move to TASKS.md. "
    "TASKS.md is organized into milestones (sections headed with '## Milestone: <name>'). "
    "Find the first milestone that has unchecked tasks — this is your current milestone. "
    "Complete every task in this milestone, then stop. Do not start the next milestone. "
    "Do tasks one at a time. For each task: do the task, commit with a meaningful message, "
    "mark it complete in TASKS.md, commit that too, run git pull --rebase, and push. "
    "When every task in the current milestone is checked, you are done for this session."

REVIEWER_PROMPT = (

    "`git diff HEAD~3 --stat` to see which files changed recently, then read the full "
    "diffs with `git diff HEAD~3`. Review the changed code for: code duplication, "
    "unclear naming, overly complex logic, missing error handling, security issues "
    "(hardcoded secrets, injection risks, missing input validation), violations of the "
    "project's conventions or tech stack, and dead or unreachable code. Do NOT flag "
    "minor style preferences or nitpicks. Only flag issues that meaningfully affect "
    "correctness, security, maintainability, or readability. If you find issues, APPEND "
    "each one to REVIEWS.md as a checkbox list item with the file, a brief description "
    "of the problem, and a suggested fix. Only append new lines — never edit, reorder, "
    "or remove existing lines in REVIEWS.md. Do not duplicate items already in REVIEWS.md. "
    "If there are no meaningful issues, do nothing. If you wrote to REVIEWS.md, commit "

    "input for review — do NOT read entire source files, do NOT review code outside the "
    "diff, and do NOT look at older changes. Focus exclusively on the added and modified "
    "lines shown in the diff. Use the surrounding context lines only to understand what "
    "the changed code does. "
    "Look for: code duplication, unclear naming, overly complex logic, missing error "
    "handling, security issues (hardcoded secrets, injection risks, missing input "
    "validation), violations of the project's conventions or tech stack, and dead or "
    "unreachable code. Do NOT flag minor style preferences or nitpicks. Only flag issues "
    "that meaningfully affect correctness, security, maintainability, or readability. "

    "file, the commit SHA {commit_sha:.8}, a brief description of the problem, and a "
    "suggested fix. Only append new lines — never edit, reorder, or remove existing "
    "lines in REVIEWS.md. Do not duplicate items already in REVIEWS.md. If there are no "

    "changed during this milestone. This is the complete diff of all work in the "
    "milestone. Review it for cross-cutting concerns that per-commit reviews miss: "
    "inconsistent patterns across files, API contracts that don't match between caller "
    "and callee, duplicated logic introduced across separate commits, missing integration "
    "between components, naming inconsistencies across the milestone's code, error "
    "handling gaps that only appear when viewing the full picture, and architectural "
    "issues in how the pieces fit together. Do NOT re-flag issues already in REVIEWS.md. "
    "Do NOT flag minor style preferences. Only flag issues that meaningfully affect "
    "correctness, security, maintainability, or readability at the system level. "

    "test coverage across the codebase. If there are major gaps — like no tests at all "
    "for a feature, or completely missing error handling tests — write a few focused "
    "tests to cover the most important gaps. Do not write tests for minor edge cases or "
    "for code that already has reasonable coverage. Write at most 5 new tests per run. "
    "Run the new tests. For any test that fails — whether existing or new — APPEND each "
    "failure to BUGS.md as a checkbox list item with a clear description of what is "
