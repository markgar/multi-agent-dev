[bug] Project materials admin endpoints collapse authorization failures into 401, returning the wrong status for authenticated non-admin users

- File: `src/Stretto.Api/Controllers/ProjectMaterialsController.cs` (auth checks in each action around lines 19-24, 47-52, 87-92, 113-118, 140-145, 199-204; helper around lines 220-225)

## Problem
`ResolveAdminMemberAsync` returns `null` for both unauthenticated users and authenticated users without admin rights, and each action maps `null` to `Unauthorized()` (401).

## Why it matters
A signed-in non-admin should receive `403 Forbidden`, not `401 Unauthorized`; returning 401 breaks client behavior that distinguishes "not logged in" from "logged in but not allowed" and can trigger incorrect re-auth flows.

## Suggested fix
Split authentication and authorization outcomes: return 401 only when no active session exists, and return 403 for authenticated non-admin users.

Example approach:
```csharp
var member = await authSessionResolver.ResolveActiveMemberAsync(HttpContext, cancellationToken);
if (member is null)
{
    return Unauthorized();
}

if (!member.IsAdmin)
{
    return Forbid();
}
```
