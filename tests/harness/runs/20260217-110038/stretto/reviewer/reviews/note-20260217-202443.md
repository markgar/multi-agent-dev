[robustness] Upload flow can leave orphaned files when metadata persistence fails after storage write

- File: `src/Stretto.Api/Controllers/ProjectMaterialsController.cs` (upload path around lines 171-188)

## Problem
`UploadProjectMaterialDocument` writes the binary content via `projectMaterialStorage.SaveAsync(...)` before inserting/saving the `ProjectMaterialDocument` row. If `SaveChangesAsync` fails, the file remains on disk without a corresponding DB record.

## Why it matters
This creates storage/metadata drift and unbounded orphaned files over time, which complicates operations and can consume disk unexpectedly.

## Suggested fix
Add compensating cleanup on persistence failure (delete written file), or stage DB+file operations so failures cannot leave partial state.

Example pattern:
```csharp
await projectMaterialStorage.SaveAsync(stream, storagePath, cancellationToken);
try
{
    dbContext.ProjectMaterialDocuments.Add(document);
    await dbContext.SaveChangesAsync(cancellationToken);
}
catch
{
    await projectMaterialStorage.DeleteIfExistsAsync(storagePath, cancellationToken);
    throw;
}
```
